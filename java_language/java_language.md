# Java Langauge

In this chapter, we will be reviewing Java components that serve as the foundation to Android development. As a reminder, it is expected that you have a working knowledge of Object Oriented Programming and the Java language prior to progressing into this course.  If you are finding the material to be too fast paced, you may want to consider taking a refresher course on the Java language and OOP development.

Java is the native programming language for the Android platform. In fact, Android itself utilizes a Java runtime layer to power its applications. By default, ART for Android Lollipop and later and Dalvik for Kitkat and earlier versions. Utilizing Java allows developers to build robust applications with a single code base that run on a wide array of hardware configurations without having to worry about deep hardware customization and support.

In addition, Java is among the most popular, highest paid, and in-demand programming languages in the world, making Android development a solid step in rounding out your programming skills as a whole. PLUS, Java is a great foundational language to extend your skills into other C based languages such as C++ and C#, or even Swift!
