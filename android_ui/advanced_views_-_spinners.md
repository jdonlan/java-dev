#Advanced Views - Spinner

Spinners are Android's take on the classic drop down menu. They provide users with the ability to select one or more options from a list of items with minimal screen real estate required. Alongside Lists and Grids, Spinners are a UI option for presenting the user with the ability to interact with a collection of information. The Spinner is typically the control of choice when presenting several options to the user alongside other visual elements on the screen.
