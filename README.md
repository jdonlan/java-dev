Developing for Android - Developer's Guide
=======

Welcome to Developing for Android!  This material was curated and created as a resource for developers to dive into mobile development.  Through this book, you will be exposed to the core tools, concepts, and techniques required to build applications for Google's Android operating system. 

## Content and Expectations

Android development involves understanding the platform SDK to build upon a foundational knowledge of the Java programming language. This book will provide a refresher for the requisite Java langauge components as well as a guide into the Android SDK.  This resource will provide broad insight into the Android platform and best practices for mobile application development.  

There is a basic expectation that you will already have a basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming technique and the Java langauge.  While the material will provide a review of core Java syntax and constructs, the aim is to get into developing for Android as quick as possible.  

While the material is intended to be mostly comprehensive, certain areas of the course will provide suggested additional research.  This research is intended to provide valuable reference and guidance in advanced application of covered topics.


## Deliverables

Throughout the program, you will be provided with challenges that require the synthesis and application of the presented material.  In many instances, successful completion of the challenges will require you to progress into suggested research as self-study.  

Assignments should be completed in a private Git repository such as GitHub or BitBucket showing regular commits and progression.
