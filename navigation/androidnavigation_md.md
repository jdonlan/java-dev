#Navigation in Android
Android's UI/UX standards have come a long way since its rise in version now offering developers with many tools to create an immersive and functional user experience. In this chapter we'll take a look at the various navigation strategies within the platform, their strengths, their weaknesses, and the platform conventions that define their use. These navigational structures include:
 
* The Navigation Drawer
* Tabbed Navigation
* Action Bar Spinner Navigation

Beyond investigating navigating between views and activities within the application, we'll explore Android's ActionBar and the functionality and consistency it brings to the application. The Android Action Bar is an integral component in many Android Applications that serves as a utility header at the top of the application, providing useful general functionality in a consistent manner throughout an application.
 
The ActionBar also provides Contextual enhancements which enable the application to provide advanced functionality at the individual element level to provide consistent, advanced functionality without cluttering the UI and confusing the user.
 
By taking advantage of Android's conventions for application navigation and behavior we'll add functionality to our application while providing users with an experience they are familiar with and enjoy.
