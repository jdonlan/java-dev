#AsyncTask
To prevent your UI thread from blocking and freezing up your UI, any long running operations should be handled on a separate thread. While Android offers several classes for creating custom threads and executing them at different times and in different orders with the java.util.concurrent package, Android also provides a very easy way to perform background operations using the AsyncTask class. AsyncTask is an abstract helper class for easily creating a new thread that takes in some data, performs some defined operations on a background thread, and returns the result of those operations when it finishes.
