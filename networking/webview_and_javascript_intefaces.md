# Web Based Applications

The majority of this book is about native Android development, so why switch to web apps now?


### Quick "Native" Apps

There's a reputation in mobile that if you don't have an app, you're not prepared for the mobile space. Using a WebView and the native activity stack for navigation, web apps enable mobile sites to have a quick mobile app in the store.  This practice isn't allowed in iOS, but Google Play still allows it for published applications.

### JavaScript Libraries

Android is great.  The SDK contains components for almost everything you'd want to do in an app and there are a great deal of libraries to fill in the gaps.  Still, there are some things Android and Java don't do well.  Take a look at the following example:
