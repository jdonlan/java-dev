# Web Based Applications

The majority of this book is about native Android development, so why switch to web apps now?


### Quick "Native" Apps

There's a reputation in mobile that if you don't have an app, you're not prepared for the mobile space. 

### JavaScript Libraries

Android is great.  The SDK contains components for almost everything you'd want to do in an app and there are a great deal of libraries to fill in the gaps.  Still, there are some things Android and Java don't do well.  Take a look at the following example:

| ![GraphView](GraphView.png) | ![d3js](d3js.png) |
| -- | -- |
| <center> [GraphView](http://www.android-graphview.org/) | <center>[d3js](https://d3js.org/) |
