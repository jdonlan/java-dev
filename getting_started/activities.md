#Activity Class Overview
Activities are a core building block for almost any Android application. In this section, we will discuss what an activity is, along with how to properly use one in your application.

The Activity class is a core building block of almost every Android application. On the surface, an Android activity is a simple application screen that contains a UI and some functionality that's tied to that UI. Activities are typically full screen, though it is possible to make floating or windowed activities, and the UI on that screen should allow for user input to create an interactive experience. If you dive a little deeper though, activities are so much more than a simple screen with some UI. Activities can respond to system events, connect to content databases, and launch other apps or system components. The more advanced topics will be introduced in a later sections. For now, we'll stick with the simple screen definition of an activity.
